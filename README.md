# espnff
In-depth data analysis for your ESPN fantasy football league. The app leverages [espn_api](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api) to mine league-specific data.

Outputs include:
- The stint of every fantasy player on every fantasy team, and the corresponding point total during the stint
- Scatterplots of draft or waiver spending vs. return-on-investment (points scored)
- Ranking of best un-drafted players
